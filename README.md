# Skixam
SkiaSharp as a platform, for Xamarin.Forms. This is a proof of concept only, project, that runs a Skia canvas as the base for each page.

Elements such as Labels, Buttons and more are drawn on to the canvas, instead of using a platform specific API. This means you only need one renderer, rather than a renderer per platform.
